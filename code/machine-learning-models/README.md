# Machine Learning Models

We are using **Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Random Forest (RF)** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to see the classifier performance on our dataset.

For feature extraction, we use **TF-IDF Vectorizer**

For dataset, we **pre-process** and **remove the stopwords**

We use Grid Search with Nested Cross Validation to select optimal hyperparameters for the classifiers.
