# Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) model

The Bi-LSTM model is trained using Fasttext Embeddings with 300 dimensions on the embedding layer.

The dataset is pre-processed and stopwords are removed.

We use Tensorflow with Keras for training our models.

Additionally, logging is done using WandB (Weights and Biases) tool.
